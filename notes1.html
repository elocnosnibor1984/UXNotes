<h1>First Notes on UX</h1>

<h3>Subject: Facebook Main Page</h3>

<p>We should have used at least a 2 column format for the FMFA project, the sidebar containing the buttons to maniupulate the feed, other functions.</p>
<p>We should have used more icons, less words to facilitate user functions</p>
<p>Put the "make a post" feature at top, not hidden on menu</p>
<p>Generally need to improve the style - especially of the posts</p>

<h3>Subject: Youtube Main Page</h3>

<p>I'm surprised I never noticed the top buttons to change between Home, Trending and Subscription before.</p>
<p>I'm also a little surprised by the hidden sidebar menu - maybe people don't use it enough to justify having it visible all the time? I don't know that I've ever used it.</p>
<p>The style is so simple - light grey lines, off white background, a series of videos and a short description ... I guess I imagine that sites that are this huge would be overflowing with features. The magic is that it gets right to showing you videos that you want to watch. It really just pushes content. If it can give you videos that you want to watch then it can show you ads and make money.</p>
<p>Again with the simple header - SiteID, Search bar, upload, alert (icon), personalized google icon (so that you share their brand across their platforms - saving them space and geting buy-in in the process). The sub navbar with just 3 choices is interesting though - I wouldn't have thought to do that. I suppose that functionality is important enough to display it so prominently?</p>
<p>The lesson of the day is to be good at giving the user what they want - and they might not want a lot of bells and whistles.</p>

<h3>Subject: Apple ios article</h3>

<p>UI is tied to screen size. As the screen size changes, so must the UI because you can't have as many options on mobile. Text size is also impacted by mobile design - needs to stay readable.</p>
<p>There needs to be significant contrast between font color and background so that it is readable - even for people with color blindness or other visual impairments.</p>
<p>Image distortion - images shouldn't be allowed to become difficult to view because of the changing screen size.</p>
<p>Layouts should be consistent and easy to use. Example: the use of color and the bar for a password's strength on registration.</p>

<h3>Subject: CNN Main Page</h3>
<p>Essentially a 3 column layout where main article gets 2 columns at the top. Gives links to the "big" stories on the left, with "bigger" stories on the right. Next, breaks into another 3 column layout where the columns are even, content divided into categories, some story overlap from above. Next comes the video section with a 4 column layout, wide column on the right (unusual). Ends with "Paid Partner Content".</p>
<p>I like the way the pictures break up the text - never more than 4 lines without a picture on the page. And the headers and line dividers are all plain in order to let the pictures pop.</p>
<p>My favorite thing about this site is the way the navigation pane opens up and covers half the screen so that you can get to nearly every category in 1 click.</p>
<p>The whole site is designed to show you content and get you to articles fast. The ads are hidden amoungst the articles on the main page, and have their own dedicated section(s).</p>
<p>The navbar is interesting too: white letters on black background - the only color is the CNN Site ID, which is also highlighted by the way it extends below the navbar. How do you do that?</p>

<h3>11/1/16</h3>
<h3>Subject: Quora Main Page</h3>
<p>Only red color is SiteID and "read" with icon -presumably these are the major focuses of the site.</p>
<p>Only the center column moves - keeps functionality on page at all times. Right column is to encourage user interaction with the site in the form of goals for the user to complete (with one always selected - visit your feed). Left column is to help you get to more interesting content? Things you've bookmarked? The left column strikes me as something that could be more clearly defined. I'm not sure what it's purpose is.</p>
<p>Pop up menu gives options related to the posts - covers up other content while clicked, post background goes grey-blue when mouse over.</p>
<p>Content itself is mostly hidden - just teases the user so they can quickly scan what is most interesting - get to more content faster.</p>
<p>On click - article becomes modal. Preserves one page app.</p>

<h3>Factors to consider when reviewing the UX/UI of a site:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>What do I want to do on the site?</li>
	<li>What does the site seem to think I want to do?</li>
	<li>Is there anything that gets in my way?</li>
	<li>Do the feature I want to use need to be displayed more prominently?</li>
	<li>What is the purpose of each screen element/group of elements?</li>
	<li>What is most -> least prominent on the site?</li>
	<li>How do I know what is clickable? Any issues with this?</li>
	<li>Is there too much on the page? Too little?</li>
	<li>How busy is the art? Does it distract?</li>
	<li>How wordy is the page?</li>
	<li>Does this seem to be a deep or shallow hierarchy?</li>
	<li>What form of navigation does the site use? (breadcrumbs, headings, active navbar elements, page names, etc)</li>
	<li>Does the homepage communicate the identity & mission?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Subject: Amazon landing page</h3>
<p>I appreciate how the site layout/design is so simple and the pictures are so clear & sharp - really puts the focus on the products - and they fill the page with products. They are trying to take you directly to things to buy.</p>
<p>They also have a really unique navbar - products at the top, then siteId and searchbar, and sub nav to get you to products in different ways - but even the navbar has product placement on it!</p>
<p>I think my favorite parts of the site are the cart icon (it shows you if you still have products in it and how many), and the soft gradient background of the main ad - it just looks so good. Another thing I like is the ubiquitous arrows at the right and left side of the page, reminding you that there is so much more to the site, so many more interesting things to buy.</p>
<p>Virtually all the product categories are delineated by the light grey lines, which span not quite the whole div - which is somehow classy.</p>

<h3>11/6/16</h3>
<h3>Subject: Chase landing page</h3>

<p>The first pane's main focus is login, followed by pushing some credit card info. The second pane's main focus is "Choose what's right for you". I really like framing the services in this way - very customer focused. It's a list of all the services that chase offers. The second half of the second pane are helpful articles meant to give users information about topics like things to consider when buying a home, making financial goals, and your credit score. These are good ways to build goodwill with your users - it shows that you are there to help them, even for free. The third pane "News and Stories" follows in a similar vein, but also has "articles" about famous people using their products. I suppose this is a way to build an image of prestige - famous, admirable people admiring your product.</p>
<p>Footer 1 presumably lists all of chase's services along with a short blurb and some links. Footer 2 contains other info about privacy, security, accessibility, site map, member of FDIC and equal opportunity housing lender.</p>

<p>I like the way the fixed navbar changes from "Chase" to just the logo, and transitions from transparent to semi transparent blue. It's a nice touch that adds to the sense that this is a very professional site.</p>


<h3>11/7/16</h3>
<h3>Subject: Amazon Search page</h3>

<p>The visual language of the page seems to be:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Bright Blue - links</li>
	<li>Dark Red - money</li>
	<li>light grey - dividers, background info</li>
	<li>Black - sidebar main info</li>
</ul>

<p>Even though the page is busy, it is really readable because of the way they break everything up - and of course reuse the patterns.</p>
<p>I had never noticed before how the subnavbars give you other search options and info about your search.</p>
<p>I don't think I'm a fan of the extra horizontal grey line above the first book - think it may just be cluttering stuff up.</p>
<p>I'm really curious to see how the sidebar works - how do they deliver all the relevant info by category? The main pane gives you the results of your search and the sidebar gives you options of other things you might be interested in.</p>

<h3>Subject: Mint Main page</h3>

<p>I love the thin, inverse nav at the top and the second, grey, fat nav with the logo beneath it. The double nav allows you to get to all sorts of information on your page. and it's an interesting choice to put the logo in the second nav. Not sure I could use this, but I like it.</p>

<p>In nav beneath nav stuff - first custom message - did accounts update and do any need attention? (link to accounts).</p>

<p>The color scheme is very similar to amazon in the way they use a dark navbar grey lines to divide everything up. Color is used very sparingly just to highlight the most important things - generally icons, but a little bit of text too.</p>
<p>When I was thinking about this site I thought graphs played a bigger role in it, many in deeper features that's the case. There aren't too many on the surface.</p>

<p>I really like the "Help" menu sliding out from the side. That's such a great way to save space + you still get to see most of the screen.</p>


<h3>11/13/16</h3>
<h3>Subject: Slate Main page</h3>
<p>I never noticed before all the different ways they frame their articles. Main article is a jumbotron, next two are just boxes - one white background, one yellow, below that a jumbotron ad, a material card, and a bigger box article. Next is a thin add for Slate+, then a box listing other article headlines, and another jumbotron but with a box inset. Then two more boxes - a wide white box and an almost square purple one, then 3 articles without boxes broken up by pipes.</p>

<p>The sidebar on the right is capped by the Slate logo, then a link to see the most recent articles in black background with white text. The articles on the right all have the tight grey angled slashes that subtly distinguish them. The Slate cap moves down the page fixed in place.</p>

<p>One of the most clever things they do is shameless repeat the articles in a three column spread at the bottom: Most read, and Most Shared, broken up by a dark "Dear Prudence" column. I like how these are numbered. It gives the impression that there are more articles and I assume that people eventually decide to click on them as they scan the page - they see each article about twice.</p>

<p>All links change to slate purple on highlight when set on white background, and to yellow when set against a dark background.</p>

<h3>11/15/16</h3>
<h3>Subject: Wired Main page</h3>

<p>Like CNN, uses different sized blocks to break up articles in a pleasing way - focus is on the accompanying photo. I don't know what to make of the navbar- the siteID takes up so much space! The fa-fa bars on the left just give the same menu options as the navbar, but with colored icons, which is interesting if not particularly useful.</p>
<p>I'm intrigued by the use of font - uppercase, lowercase, serif, sans-serif, and font size are all different based on the box it seems. I don't see the rhyme or reason for it, but it works somehow.</p>
<p>As you scroll down the navbar compresses somewhat and you have to use the fafa bars to get to a different section.</p>
<p>I like how the title of each article is always bigger and in black and the category and freshness labels are in grey and are consistent across all the boxes.</p>


<h3>11/21/16</h3>
<h3>Subject: Smashing Magazine Article page</h3>

<p>I was intrigued by the double sidebar menu as well as the nested three column layout. I thought it was a really interesting way to do all of those things. I appreciate how the nested layout helps create a better sense of what is associated with what. I'm not really a fan of ads (who is?), but the way they weave in and out with the content is well done.</p>

<h3>11/22/16</h3>
<h3>Subject: Santa Clara Library Catalog</h3>

<p>Search is at the top (broken up by catagories to search by, which seems like a usability problem), then the navbar. I like that the next big lettering is the term used to search, and then it essentially goes into a two column layout between filters on the left and results on the right. The description seems to have more white space than seems strictly necessary, but the text is large to help people read it, which may account for some of that. "Available" link drops a modal, which is cool. Title, author, rating, format, ?. I have no idea what the "For later" function in the top right does. Why does the detail view simply omit the picture of the cover? and why would you ever need to print the books and locations? At least the print view is substantially different in layout, which is what I expected from the "detail view".</p>

<p>I really like how library announcements are shown in red under the nav - no way to miss them. That's great functionality. I like the clean grey lines in the design - everything is broken up clearly and the fonts are easy to read. The cards on the grey background are another nice touch. There are at least 4 shades of light grey on the page. And the page links are all in light blue, which is somewhat web standard.</p>
