<p>We should have used at least a 2 column format for the FMFA project, the sidebar containing the buttons to maniupulate the feed, other functions.</p>
<p>We should have used more icons, less words to facilitate user functions</p>
<p>Put the "make a post" feature at top, not hidden on menu</p>
<p>Generally need to improve the style - especially of the posts</p>
