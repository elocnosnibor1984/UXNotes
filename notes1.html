<h1>First Notes on UX</h1>

<h3>Subject: Facebook Main Page</h3>

<p>We should have used at least a 2 column format for the FMFA project, the sidebar containing the buttons to maniupulate the feed, other functions.</p>
<p>We should have used more icons, less words to facilitate user functions</p>
<p>Put the "make a post" feature at top, not hidden on menu</p>
<p>Generally need to improve the style - especially of the posts</p>

<h3>Subject: Youtube Main Page</h3>

<p>I'm surprised I never noticed the top buttons to change between Home, Trending and Subscription before.</p>
<p>I'm also a little surprised by the hidden sidebar menu - maybe people don't use it enough to justify having it visible all the time? I don't know that I've ever used it.</p>
<p>The style is so simple - light grey lines, off white background, a series of videos and a short description ... I guess I imagine that sites that are this huge would be overflowing with features. The magic is that it gets right to showing you videos that you want to watch. It really just pushes content. If it can give you videos that you want to watch then it can show you ads and make money.</p>
<p>Again with the simple header - SiteID, Search bar, upload, alert (icon), personalized google icon (so that you share their brand across their platforms - saving them space and geting buy-in in the process). The sub navbar with just 3 choices is interesting though - I wouldn't have thought to do that. I suppose that functionality is important enough to display it so prominently?</p>
<p>The lesson of the day is to be good at giving the user what they want - and they might not want a lot of bells and whistles.</p>

<h3>Subject: Apple ios article</h3>

<p>UI is tied to screen size. As the screen size changes, so must the UI because you can't have as many options on mobile. Text size is also impacted by mobile design - needs to stay readable.</p>
<p>There needs to be significant contrast between font color and background so that it is readable - even for people with color blindness or other visual impairments.</p>
<p>Image distortion - images shouldn't be allowed to become difficult to view because of the changing screen size.</p>
<p>Layouts should be consistent and easy to use. Example: the use of color and the bar for a password's strength on registration.</p>

<h3>Subject: CNN Main Page</h3>
<p>Essentially a 3 column layout where main article gets 2 columns at the top. Gives links to the "big" stories on the left, with "bigger" stories on the right. Next, breaks into another 3 column layout where the columns are even, content divided into categories, some story overlap from above. Next comes the video section with a 4 column layout, wide column on the right (unusual). Ends with "Paid Partner Content".</p>
<p>I like the way the pictures break up the text - never more than 4 lines without a picture on the page. And the headers and line dividers are all plain in order to let the pictures pop.</p>
<p>My favorite thing about this site is the way the navigation pane opens up and covers half the screen so that you can get to nearly every category in 1 click.</p>
<p>The whole site is designed to show you content and get you to articles fast. The ads are hidden amoungst the articles on the main page, and have their own dedicated section(s).</p>
<p>The navbar is interesting too: white letters on black background - the only color is the CNN Site ID, which is also highlighted by the way it extends below the navbar. How do you do that?</p>

<h3>Subject: Quora Main Page</h3>
<p>Only red color is SiteID and "read" with icon -presumably these are the major focuses of the site.</p>
<p>Only the center column moves - keeps functionality on page at all times. Right column is to encourage user interaction with the site in the form of goals for the user to complete (with one always selected - visit your feed). Left column is to help you get to more interesting content? Things you've bookmarked? The left column strikes me as something that could be more clearly defined. I'm not sure what it's purpose is.</p>
<p>Pop up menu gives options related to the posts - covers up other content while clicked, post background goes grey-blue when mouse over.</p>
<p>Content itself is mostly hidden - just teases the user so they can quickly scan what is most interesting - get to more content faster.</p>
<p>On click - article becomes modal. Preserves one page app.</p>

<h3>Factors to consider when reviewing the UX/UI of a site:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>What do I want to do on the site?</li>
	<li>What does the site seem to think I want to do?</li>
	<li>Is there anything that gets in my way?</li>
	<li>Do the feature I want to use need to be displayed more prominently?</li>
	<li>What is the purpose of each screen element/group of elements?</li>
	<li>What is most -> least prominent on the site?</li>
	<li>How do I know what is clickable? Any issues with this?</li>
	<li>Is there too much on the page? Too little?</li>
	<li>How busy is the art? Does it distract?</li>
	<li>How wordy is the page?</li>
	<li>Does this seem to be a deep or shallow hierarchy?</li>
	<li>What form of navigation does the site use? (breadcrumbs, headings, active navbar elements, page names, etc)</li>
	<li>Does the homepage communicate the identity & mission?</li>
</ul>
